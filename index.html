          Explore the Great Lakes of Michigan today by booking a date at one of
          our beautiful beaches across the state. We offer campsites at each
          location for families traveling in RV's. There is also daily parking
          from 10am-6pm every single day.
        </p>
        <h2>What to Wear</h2>
        <p>
          If it is a hot day out, make sure to bring the shade and some
          sunscreen! Temperatures can get very hot and exposure to sun is to be
          expected. Don't forget your sandles and a swimsuit because you will
          not want to miss out on our beautiful lakes. Once the sun goes down,
          make sure to have something to bundle up with because temperatures can
          drop significantly. Be prepared to best enjoy your beach experience
          along the shores of Michigan.
        </p>
        <h2>Reservations</h2>
        <p>
          We accept reservations two weeks ahead of a date, or further. If you
          are interested, please contact the Department of Natural Resources to
          guarantee a spot today! Reservations are first come first serve so
          make sure you don't miss out!

          Whether it's during spring, summer, fall or winter, Michigan always
          has beautiful scenery and endless options and activities for every
          season. My family and I have made it a goal to return every year on
          vacation to experience a new wonder of Michigan. Last year we cliff
          jumped up in Marquette, MI at the Black Rocks and this year we are
          going to be visiting state parks on the north east corner of the state
          by the thumb! Can't wait!
